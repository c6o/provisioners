How do I make a contribution?
----
Never made an open source contribution before?
​
Wondering how contributions work in the in our project?
​
Here's a quick rundown!
----
1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
​
1. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under **your-GitHub-username/provisioners**.
​
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using ```git clone https://github.com/github-username/provisioners.git```.
​
1. Create a new branch for your fix using ```git checkout -b branch-name-here```.
​
1. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
​
1. Use ```git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here``` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
​
1. Use ```git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"``` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
​
1. Push the changes to the remote repository using ```git push origin branch-name-here```.
​
1. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
​
1. Title the pull request with a ***short description*** of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
​
1. In the description of the pull request, ***explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer***. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
​
1. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
​
1. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
​
1. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
