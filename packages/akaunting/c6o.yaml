  Akaunting requires access to a MySql or MariaDB database along with a user with 'mysql_native_password' authentication.  This has been created prior to the installation.


  Here is a sample script to get you started


    ~~~~

    CREATE DATABASE akaunting;

    CREATE USER 'akaunting'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '88888888';

    ALTER USER 'akaunting'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '88888888';

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON akaunting.* TO 'akaunting'@'%';

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    SELECT User, Plugin FROM mysql.user;

    ~~~~

    Be sure to change the value '88888888' with a secure password.
