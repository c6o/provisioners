  Setup

  ----

  Strapi requires access to a Postgresql database with a few users created in the database.  This has been created prior to the installation.


  Here is a sample script, for postgresql to get you started


    ~~~~

    CREATE DATABASE bonitadb;

    CREATE DATABASE bonitabusinessdb;

    CREATE USER bonita WITH PASSWORD '88888888';

    CREATE USER bonitabusiness WITH PASSWORD '88888888';

    GRANT ALL ON DATABASE bonitadb TO bonita;

    GRANT ALL ON DATABASE bonitabusinessdb TO bonitabusiness;

    ~~~~

    Be sure to change the value '88888888' with a secure password.
