description:
  Apache Cassandra is a highly-scalable partitioned row store. Rows are organized into tables with a required primary key.


  [Partitioning](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Partitioners) means that Cassandra can distribute your data across multiple machines in an application-transparent matter. Cassandra will automatically repartition as machines are added and removed from the cluster.


  [Row store](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel) means that like relational databases, Cassandra organizes data by rows and columns. The Cassandra Query Language (CQL) is a close relative of SQL.


  For more information, see the [Apache Cassandra web site](http://cassandra.apache.org/).
