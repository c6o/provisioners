description:
  Checkmk combines three types of IT monitoring


  * Status-based monitoring, which (via thresholds) records the "health" of a device or application.

  * Metric-based monitoring that enables the recording and analysis of time series graphs. For the CEE both an HTML5-based graphing system and an integration with Grafana are available.

  * Log-based and event-based monitoring, in which key events can be filtered out and actions can be triggered based on these events.


  In order to ensure a very broad monitoring, Checkmk currently has 1700+ plug-ins in each edition â€“ all of which are licensed under GPLv2. These plug-ins are maintained as part of the product and are regularly supplemented with additional plug-ins or extensions. Connecting existing legacy Nagios plug-ins is possible as well.


  To simplify setup and operation, all components of Checkmk are delivered fully integrated. A rule-based 1:n configuration, as well as a high degree of automation significantly accelerate workflows. This includes


  * Auto-discovery of hosts (where applicable)

  * Auto-discovery of services

  * Automated configuration of plug-ins via preconfigured thresholds and rules

  * Automated agent updates (a CEE feature)

  * Automatic and dynamic configuration that enables the monitoring of volatile services with a lifespan of just a few seconds, such as in the Kubernetes environment (starting from CEE v1.6)

  * Automated discovery of tags and labels from sources such as Kubernetes, AWS and Azure (starting from CEE v1.6)


  In addition, there are also playbooks for the use of configuration and deployment tools such as Ansible or Salt.


  Checkmk is often used in very large distributed environments where a high number of sites (e.g. 300 locations of Faurecia) and/or well over 100.000 devices (e.g. Edeka) are monitored. This is possible, among other things, because Checkmk's microcore consumes much less CPU resources than, for example Nagios, and therefore offers a significantly higher performance on the same hardware. Furthermore the non-persistent data is stored in-memory in RAM which significantly improves the access time.
