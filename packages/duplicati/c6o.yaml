Duplicati supports not only various online backup services like OneDrive, Amazon S3, Backblaze, Rackspace Cloud Files, Tahoe LAFS, and Google Drive, but also any servers that support SSH/SFTP, WebDAV, or FTP.


  Duplicati uses standard components such as rdiff, zip, AESCrypt, and GnuPG. This allows users to recover backup files even if Duplicati is not available. Released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), Duplicati is free software.
