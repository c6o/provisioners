  Self-Hosted File Sync and Sharing

  =====


  No import required

  ----

  Just like you do with an FTP server, point FileRun to where you keep the files on your server and you will get instant web access to them.


  Want to access your files also by FTP, SMB or WebDAV (server included)? No problem. Upload, download or manage the same files.


  All changes made to the files using FTP or other method reflect via FileRun without delay.


  Send file requests

  ----


  File requests allow you to collect and receive files from anyone, right into your FileRun user account, with just a link.


  File requests are ideal for receiving a large file or collection of files, collecting photos after a special event, and requesting submissions from coworkers and clients.


  Guest users

  ----


  Collaborate with other people without creating accounts for them.


  Getting feedback on documents, photos or any type of file has never been this easy.


  Your files everywhere

  ----


  Access your files from wherever you are using the free mobile apps.


  Sync files from your desktop using the free desktop apps.


  Access via WebDAV. FileRun comes with its own embedded WebDAV server. No server configuration needed.
