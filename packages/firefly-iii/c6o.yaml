description:
  Firefly III is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. Using a bunch of external tools, you can import data. It also has many neat financial reports available.


  Firefly III should give you insight into and control over your finances. Money should be useful, not scary. You should be able to see where it is going, to feel your expenses and to... wow, I'm going overboard with this aren't I?

  But you get the idea, this is your money. These are your expenses. Stop them from controlling you. I built this tool because I started to dislike money. Having money, not having money, paying bills with money, you get the idea. But no more. I want to feel "safe", whatever my balance is. And I hope this tool can help you. I know it helps me.


  Setup

  ----

  Firefly requires access to a MySql database along with a user with 'mysql_native_password' authentication.  This has been created prior to the installation.


  Here is a sample script to get you started


    ~~~~

    CREATE DATABASE firefly;

    CREATE USER 'firefly'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '88888888';

    ALTER USER 'firefly'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '88888888';

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON firefly.* TO 'firefly'@'%';

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    SELECT User, Plugin FROM mysql.user;

    ~~~~

    Be sure to change the value '88888888' with a secure password.
