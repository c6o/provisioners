description:
  Moodle is a learning platform designed to provide educators, administrators and learners with a single robust, secure and integrated system to create personalised learning environments. You can download the software onto your own web server or ask one of our knowledgeable Moodle Partners to assist you.

  Moodle is built by the Moodle project which is led and coordinated by Moodle HQ, which is financially supported by a network of over 80 Moodle Partner service companies worldwide.


  Setup

  ----

  Moodle requires access to a MariaDB database along with a user for authentication.  This has been created prior to the installation.


  Here is a sample script to get you started


    ~~~~

    CREATE DATABASE moodle;

    CREATE USER 'moodle'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '88888888';

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO 'moodle'@'%';

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    SELECT User, Plugin FROM mysql.user;

    ~~~~

    Be sure to change the value '88888888' with a secure password.
