description:

  Plex Media Server (PMS) is the back-end media server component of Plex, free of charge. It organizes audio and visual content from personal media libraries and streams it to their player counterparts, either on the same machine, the same local area network, or over the Internet. It can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NAS devices, or on Nvidia Shield TV.


  The server can acquire content from files, iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture, or the Internet. The music library is automatically organized by ID3 or M4A tags, such as title, artist, album, genre, year, and popularity. Plex Pass users also have the ability to access the whole music video catalog from VEVO.


  Player apps are Plex's front-end allowing the user to manage and play music, photos, videos and online content from the Plex Media Server. Most of them are free of charge.
