  rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync. rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines, and remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard links whenever possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required.


  It is written entirely in perl with no module dependencies, and has been tested with versions 5.004 through 5.24.3. It should work on any reasonably modern UNIX compatible OS.
