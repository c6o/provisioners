  Machine data, for humans.
description:
  Seq creates the visibility you need to quickly identify and diagnose problems in complex applications and microservices.


  Collect application logs - Application logs are the most useful data available for detecting and solving a wide range of production issues and outages. Seq makes it easier to pinpoint the events and patterns in application behavior that show your system is working correctly â€” or why it isn't.


  Seq is built for modern structured logging with message templates. Rather than waste time and effort trying to extract data from plain-text logs with fragile log parsing, the properties associated with each log event are captured and sent to Seq in a clean JSON format. Message templates are supported natively by ASP.NET Core, Serilog, NLog, and many other libraries, so your application can use the best available diagnostic logging for your platform.


  Seq accepts logs via HTTP, GELF, custom inputs, and the seqcli command-line client, with plug-ins or integrations available for .NET Core, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker, message queues, and many other technologies.
